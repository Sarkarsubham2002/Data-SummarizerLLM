{"query": "Install Python and Required Libraries:\r\n\r\nIf you plan to use Python for GPU-related tasks, install Python and libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, which support GPU acceleration. You can use a package manager like pip or conda for this purpose.\r\nConfigure Visual Studio Code:\r\n\r\nOpen Visual Studio Code.\r\nInstall the Python extension for VS Code if you haven't already. This extension provides a Python environment within VS Code.\r\nConfigure your Python interpreter in VS Code to use the Python installation with GPU support. You can do this by clicking on the Python version in the bottom status bar and selecting the appropriate interpreter.\r\nWrite and Run Code:\r\n\r\nWrite your Python code that utilizes GPU acceleration, such as deep learning models with TensorFlow or PyTorch.\r\nWhen you run your code, it should automatically utilize the GPU if your Python environment is correctly configured.\r\nMonitor GPU Usage:\r\n\r\nTo monitor GPU usage, you can use tools like NVIDIA's nvidia-smi if you're using an external GPU. For AMD GPUs, you may use AMD's equivalent tools.\r\nCheck for GPU Support in Libraries:", "result": [{"summary_text": "If you plan to use Python for GPU-related tasks, install Python and libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
